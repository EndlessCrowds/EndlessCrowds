# Hi, I'm Roger 👋


I'm not a traditional software engineer—My background is in business and operations, but I love technology. I've been working in the crowdfunding space since 2012, helping communities fund their goals.

Currently refactoring my crowdfunding ventures. My goal is to deploy a Monorepo architecture that powers both the web and native mobile apps.

I'm also building the **Agent Proof Protocol**, trying to solve the problem of trust between human crowds and AI agents.

I'm here to build, learn, and connect.

Always happy to chat about crowdsourcing, startups, or business.
